## PRK firmware (public beta)

PRK is a keyboard firmware written and configured in [PicoRuby](https://github.com/hasumikin/picoruby) which is an alternative mruby implementation targeting on one-chip microcontroller.

### Features

- A "keymap" can be configured in Ruby which is a concise, readable and happy language
- Raspberry Pi Pico is the platform microcontroller
- You can write your own "action" which will be invoked when you tap or hold a key ([example]()(TBD))

### Getting started

- Setup Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK

  - Follow the instructions on [https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk#quick-start-your-own-project](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk#quick-start-your-own-project)

  - Be knowledgeable how to install a UF2 file into Raspi Pico on [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/#getting-started-with-c](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/#getting-started-with-c)

- Clone the `prk_firmware` (this repository) wherever you like

    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/hasumikin/prk_firmware.git # Don't forget --recursive
    cd prk_firmware
    ```

- Clone a keymap repository, for example, "meishi2" which is a 2x2 matrix card-shaped keyboard in `keyboards` directory

    ```
    cd keyboards
    git clone https://github.com/hasumikin/prk_meishi2.git
    ```

- Build with `cmake`

    ```
    cd prk_meishi2
    cmake ../..
    build
    ```

    Now you should have `prk_firmware.uf2` file in `prk_firmware/keyboards/prk_meishi2` directory.
